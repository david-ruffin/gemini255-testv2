# SEC Application Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the SEC application to use the agent-based approach. We will replace the functionality in `main.py` and `sec_analyzer.py` with a modified version of `sec.py` that integrates with `app.py`.

## Phase 1: Query Confirmation Mechanism

**Goal**: Implement the query confirmation functionality in the agent-based approach.

1. **Analyze Current Implementation**
   - Review `confirm_understanding` function in `main.py`
   - Identify how parameters are extracted from queries in the current implementation
   - Understand how the confirmation flow integrates with the web interface

2. **Modify `sec.py` for Query Confirmation**
   - Create a new function `agent_confirm_understanding(query)` in `sec.py`
   - Implement parameter extraction using the LLM to identify company, form type, year, and info type
   - Format the confirmation message similar to the current application
   - Return both the extracted parameters and the confirmation message

3. **Update `app.py` Filing Analysis Endpoint**
   - Modify `/api/filing/analyze` to use the new confirmation function
   - Add a preliminary step that extracts parameters and returns a confirmation message
   - Update frontend AJAX handlers to manage the confirmation flow
   - Test the confirmation mechanism with various query types

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end flow from query input to confirmation to analysis
   - Verify parameter extraction accuracy
   - Fix any issues with the confirmation dialogue

## Phase 2: Agent-Based Analysis Integration

**Goal**: Replace the core analysis functionality with the agent-based approach.

1. **Agent Integration**
   - Create a new module `agent_interface.py` that wraps the functionality from `sec.py`
   - Implement a `process_confirmed_query(query, parameters)` function that:
     - Sets up the agent using `setup_agent()` from `sec.py`
     - Preprocesses the query with `resolve_relative_date_terms`
     - Invokes the agent with the query
     - Extracts and formats the response for the web application
   - Add error handling and logging appropriate for web context

2. **Update Analysis Endpoint**
   - Modify `/api/filing/analyze` to call the new agent interface after confirmation
   - Replace calls to `analyze_sec_filing` with the new agent-based analysis
   - Update response format to maintain compatibility with the frontend

3. **Frontend Compatibility**
   - Ensure the agent response format is compatible with the current frontend
   - Update any frontend JS parsing logic if needed

4. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - Test various queries to ensure the agent provides accurate responses
   - Compare results with the original implementation
   - Address any issues with response quality or format

## Phase 3: PDF Handling Integration

**Goal**: Implement PDF retrieval and display using the agent-based approach.

1. **Analyze Current PDF Workflow**
   - Review `download_filing_as_pdf` in `main.py`
   - Understand how PDFs are stored and served

2. **Implement PDF Handling in Agent Interface**
   - Add a function to `agent_interface.py` to handle filing URL retrieval
   - Determine approach:
     - Option A: Use direct SEC URLs in the frontend
     - Option B: Download and store PDFs in Azure like the current implementation
   - Implement the chosen approach

3. **Update PDF Viewing Route**
   - Modify `/api/filings/<filename>` if needed for compatibility
   - Ensure proper URL generation for PDF viewing

4. **Frontend PDF Integration**
   - Ensure the PDF iframe receives the correct URL
   - Test PDF loading and rendering in the split-screen interface

## Phase 4: Environment-Based Logging

**Goal**: Implement a unified logging system that works both locally and in Azure.

1. **Create Enhanced Logger Module**
   - Create `enhanced_logger.py` that supports both local and Azure logging
   - Implement environment-based configuration using an env variable
   - Provide compatibility with the agent's logging functions

2. **Update Agent to Use Enhanced Logger**
   - Modify `sec.py` to use the enhanced logger
   - Ensure all existing log calls are migrated

3. **Update App to Use Enhanced Logger**
   - Replace current logging in `app.py` with the enhanced logger
   - Ensure consistent logging format across components

4. **Test Logging in Both Environments**
   - Verify local logging works as expected
   - Test Azure logging with appropriate credentials

## Phase 5: Test Results Storage

**Goal**: Implement test results storage for feedback compatible with current functionality.

1. **Analyze Current Implementation**
   - Review how test results are stored in the current application
   - Understand the schema and access patterns in `test_results.html`

2. **Create Test Results Storage Module**
   - Implement `test_results_storage.py` that supports both local and Azure storage
   - Use environment variable to determine storage location
   - Implement CRUD operations for test results

3. **Integrate with Agent Analysis**
   - Update `agent_interface.py` to record analysis results
   - Include metadata such as company, form type, year, and query
   - Store the agent's response and relevant context

4. **Update Test Results API Endpoints**
   - Modify `/api/test-results` endpoints to use the new storage module
   - Ensure compatibility with the existing frontend

5. **Test Feedback Functionality**
   - Submit test queries and verify results are stored
   - Test feedback submission and retrieval
   - Verify export functionality works as expected

## Phase 6: Complete Integration and Testing

**Goal**: Finalize the integration and ensure all components work together.

1. **Cleanup and Code Optimization**
   - Remove unused code from original implementation
   - Refactor redundant functionality
   - Optimize agent prompts and tool usage

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all major paths through the application
   - Verify error handling and edge cases
   - Test with a variety of query types

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize token usage in prompts
   - Consider caching strategies if appropriate

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Document environment setup requirements
   - Create user guide for new capabilities

## Phase 7: Deployment and Monitoring

**Goal**: Deploy the refactored application and establish monitoring.

1. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Update requirements.txt with new dependencies
   - Create deployment scripts for Azure
   - Set up environment variables

2. **Staged Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Perform system testing
   - Address any environment-specific issues

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor initial usage
   - Be ready for quick fixes if issues arise

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement application monitoring
   - Set up alerting for critical errors
   - Establish regular log analysis

## Timeline and Priorities

- **Week 1**: Complete Phases 1 & 2 (Query Confirmation and Agent Integration)
- **Week 2**: Complete Phases 3 & 4 (PDF Handling and Logging)
- **Week 3**: Complete Phase 5 (Test Results Storage)
- **Week 4**: Complete Phases 6 & 7 (Integration, Testing, and Deployment)

**Critical Path**: The agent integration (Phase 2) is the most critical component, as it replaces the core functionality of the application. All other phases depend on this being completed successfully.
